# Missing Assets

The following files need to be added to your `public` folder for the site to display correctly:

## Required Files

1. **bruce.jpg** - Photo of Yi-Yu (Bruce) Liu (Tech Founder)
   - Size: Recommended 400x400px or larger (square format)
   - Location: Place in `public/bruce.jpg`
   - After adding, rebuild with `npm run build`

2. **iva.png** - Photo of Iva Bosotina (Operations Founder)  
   - Size: Recommended 400x400px or larger (square format)
   - Location: Place in `public/iva.png`
   - After adding, rebuild with `npm run build`

3. **phone-demo.mp4** - Demo video for the phone mockup
   - Format: MP4 video
   - Recommended: Vertical orientation, optimized for web
   - Location: Place in `public/phone-demo.mp4`
   - After adding, rebuild with `npm run build`

## Quick Steps

1. Add the missing files to the `public/` folder
2. Run `npm run build` to rebuild
3. The files will automatically be copied to the `out/` directory

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Images

If you don't have these files yet, you can temporarily:
- Create simple placeholder images
- Use a service like placeholder.com
- Remove the images temporarily and update the component
